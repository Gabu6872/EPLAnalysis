# __EPL Analysis__
## __Executive Summary__
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of English Premier League (EPL) players' performance data. Utilizing various data analysis techniques and visualizations, we aim to uncover insights into player statistics, performance trends, and key factors influencing success in the EPL.

## __Problem Analysis__
The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the performance metrics of EPL players and how these metrics correlate with overall team success. By analyzing detailed player statistics, we seek to answer the following questions:

## __What are the key performance indicators for players in different positions?__
How do various metrics like goals, assists, passes, and defensive actions contribute to a team's performance?
What trends can be observed in player performance over the season?

## __Key Findings__
1. _Performance Indicators:_ Midfielders and forwards have distinct key performance indicators, with goals and assists being more critical for forwards, while passing accuracy and defensive actions are more relevant for midfielders.
2. _Team Success Correlation:_ Teams with higher average xG (expected goals) and xA (expected assists) tend to perform better in the league.
3. _Age and Performance:_ Younger players, especially those under 25, show higher variability in performance, while experienced players tend to have more consistent metrics.
   
## __Conclusion__
This analysis highlights the multifaceted nature of player performance in the EPL. By understanding the key metrics and their impact on team success, coaches, analysts, and fans can gain deeper insights into the game. Future work could extend this analysis to compare different leagues or include more advanced metrics like player tracking data.
